<h1> Arithmetic </h1>

### Intorduction
<h4>It's pobably no news to you that anything can be a game, and i would argue that kids prove this thises every day. Arithmetic is and attemt to gamify an arbetrary task like drawing single digit numbers.</h4>

### Project outline
##### Rules
- In Arithmetic you score points by drawing the correct answer to arithmetic problems.
- The problems get incrementaly longer as you play
- The problmes are displayed with text
- The playes has a 10s time limit to answer
- Game ends when player gives a wrong answer or unbale to answer before time ends

##### Code
- The POC will use streamlit for backend hosting
- The Player will be able to draw numbers on a virtual scetchboard
- The drawnings are clssified with a machine learnig model trained on the MNIST digits dataset
- Aritmetic problems are generated with different verbosety
- The games has levals depending one player score
- Time limit of 6s
- End game screean statistics
- Suggestions on Aritmetic "tricks" for solving probelms in your head.
